# Planet Sakaar of Data Science

> Sakaar, a colourful garbage planet surrounded by wormholes in the Marvel Universe.

Over the years I had collected and created different codes and notebooks to try out new models/libraries/algorithms etc. A lot of them were for me trying to figure out a problem. Few of them were made into a blog post or paper. Recently, I also created a lot of notebooks to try to help with user problem on PyMC3 discourse. Some of these codes are already on my Gist, but a dedicated project might help to organise them more coherently.

Like planet Sakaar, this is a colourful place with mostly rough, raw stuff (and yes, garbage), but if you keep digging there might be some treasures that suit your need.
